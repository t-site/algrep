# algrep

algrep is almost grep.

algrep is a bash script as grep wrapper , fast and slack.

it just do grep as humans.

if you have many text files with hexadecimal pathname,

data/1.txt data/2.txt .... data/3efc60.txt

algrep search from random origin, search sequential, end random point.

algrep is fast, but "almost" grep. 

no warranty.
